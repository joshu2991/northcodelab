      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>While working on a production Laravel application, I encountered a critical performance issue: a report generation query was taking over 13 seconds to execute. This was impacting user experience and system performance significantly.</p>
      <p>The query was complex, joining multiple tables with millions of records and performing aggregations across date ranges.</p>

      <h2>Initial Analysis</h2>
      <p>First, I used Laravel&apos;s query logging and EXPLAIN to understand what was happening:</p>
      <pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</code></pre>
      <p>The results showed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full table scans on multiple tables</li>
        <li>No proper indexing on join columns</li>
        <li>Missing composite indexes for WHERE clauses</li>
        <li>Inefficient subqueries</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Strategic Indexing</h3>
      <p>I created targeted indexes on frequently joined columns and WHERE clause conditions:</p>
      <pre><code>{`CREATE INDEX idx_user_date ON transactions(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_status_type ON orders(status, type);`}</code></pre>

      <h3>2. Query Refactoring</h3>
      <p>I broke down the complex query into optimized parts, eliminating unnecessary joins and using more efficient aggregation methods.</p>

      <h3>3. Database Structure Optimization</h3>
      <p>I reviewed and normalized the database schema, reducing redundant data and improving relationship definitions.</p>

      <h3>4. Caching Strategy</h3>
      <p>For frequently accessed reports, I implemented Redis caching with smart invalidation strategies.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Query time reduced from 13 seconds to 1 second</li>
        <li>Database load decreased by 85%</li>
        <li>User satisfaction significantly improved</li>
        <li>Cost savings on database infrastructure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always analyze query execution plans before optimization</li>
        <li>Strategic indexing is more important than adding many indexes</li>
        <li>Sometimes refactoring the query is better than adding indexes</li>
        <li>Caching should be part of the optimization strategy, not the only solution</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Optimizing database queries requires a systematic approach and understanding of how databases work under the hood.</p>
